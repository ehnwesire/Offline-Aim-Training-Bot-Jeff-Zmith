# Offline Aim Training Bot Jeff Zmith
To use the bot, download botprofile.db and copy it to your Counter Strike: Global Offensive's directory: X:\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo. It is ok to override the original file but you might not be able to with Easy, Medium and Harmless Bots because of some issues. Then, download cfg/bot_prac to your Counter Strike: Global Offensive's cfg directory(within the csgo folder): X:\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg.

Enter the game with your console opened. Jump into a "Practice with bots" game and select Expert Difficulty for bots with AK/M4 and Hard for bots with SMGs (P90, Mac-10, MP9, UMP45, MP7). Select a map and wait for the game to load. Once the loading finishes, type "exec bot_prac" in the console. The game should restart in 3 seconds. After the restart you may choose to enter "pause" in console to pause the game and adjust the amount of bots by "bot_kick; bot_add_t; bot_add_ct"(The game fills the teams by bots by default). After kicking/adding bots type "pause" again and you are good to practice aim with the bot!
